# AKS Base Driver

This is a base data storage driver for the reference implementation of the  [HTTP Authoritative Keyserver](https://github.com/AuthoritativeKeyServerWG/aks).

This library provides common validation that can be leveraged by different driver implementations and a core set of unit tests that can be used as a starting point for drivers.
